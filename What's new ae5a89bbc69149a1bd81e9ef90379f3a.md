# What's new?

## February 19, 2021

iOS v1.49 & Chrome v1.x

ðŸ“š  **Library**: We've done away with the inbox, because you don't need another one of those... Everything you save now goes into your **Library**. You can then move the item onto a list, or just keep it 'unsorted'.

ðŸ‘“  **Daily Reads**: Upnext features 5 items from your Library on the Home screen. We only pick items that support our reader mode and have not marked as done yet.

ðŸ—£  **Share lists**: Share your lists with friends and colleagues. If they don't have Upnext, they will see the list as a webpage.

ðŸŽ¨  **Lists 2.0**: Customize your lists with a list icon and cover image. 

We also rebuilt and redesigned large parts of the mobile app based on feedback from our last alpha release, favoriting lists, new reader fonts, added in-app browser, account settings, further improvements to our article parser and squashed a ton of pesky bugs... ðŸª³ðŸ’¥
