# Getting started

Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
Thank you for being a part of the Upnext private alpha! 

This brief guide will give you an overview of how to get most out of Upnext.

## Saving to Upnext

Whether you are starting your personal reading list, or are curating lists of content, the first step is to save some content to Upnext.

We've made it as simple as possible! ðŸ¥³

**On your phone**: open the Share menu from (almost) any app and tap the Upnext icon in order to save the content to your library.

**On your computer:** tap the Upnext icon in your Chrome toolbar to save the content to your library.

## Organizing

Anything you save in Upnext gets added to your Library, where you can filter and sort your saved items.

### Adding content to lists

You can organize saved items onto lists:

1. By tapping 'Move to list...' when saving an item.
2. By swiping on an item in the Library or from the More (...) menu in the reader.

### Creating and editing lists

The Lists tab on the Library screen shows you all the lists you created and/or are following.

You can also create a new list from this screen, or open any of lists and tap the list icon to edit the title, description or customize the list icon.

> You can also quickly create a new list when saving or adding an item to a list.

### Marking items as done

Saved items and lists can be marked as done throughout the app. When you mark something as done, it will remain in your Library but will no longer show by default, unless you update the filter settings to show completed items.

> Upnext gets even better with our Chrome extension! 
[Install it now](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/upnext/hjgngigpjehgifcepdhlnnikibmgeflc) to start saving content from your computer as well.

## Reading

Now that you've saved your content, it's time to read ðŸ“–.  The Upnext homes creen makes it easy to find someothing from your library to read.  Each day we'll pick five items you've saved in the past.  It's a great way to discover content you've forgotten you had.  The home screen also shows content you're in the process of reading and items you've recently saved so you can find them quickly.
